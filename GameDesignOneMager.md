# One-Pager Assignment: Game Design Principles


## 1. Balanced Gameplay Options
Providing players with multiple choices to make instead of following a strict guideline. Players can have multiple options to choose from. For example, in The Witcher III,  you’re able to customize and choose from different armor and weapons based on your enemies or skill level, rather than having to stick with the same items throughout the whole game.
**Pros:** Allows players to customize their gameplay to cater to their own experience, freedom to choose from various options and try out different things, and reach goals.
**Cons:** More complex process with more time and effort spent designing and developing these various options, choice overload from having too many options in some games.  
**Usage:** I would try to use this design principle as much as I could to make my game allow for more options given to the player.

## 2. Have a Core Mission
Most popular game titles surround their objective with a meaningful core mission; for example, Tetris has a simple objective of “getting as many 5-row combos as possible”. This can also apply to more drawn-out story games like Zelda, making the core mission to defeat Ganon and save Princess Zelda. In Majora’s Mask, there is even a 3-day time limit to save Hyrule.  
**Pros:** Allows for an immersive experience to encourage players to continue their gameplay until the end.
**Cons:** Core mechanics that follow a repetitive gameplay loop can feel boring if not given room to explore more options and only follow one path, like including side missions and such. Creating games with time constraints can also cause more stress and feel overwhelming. 
**Usage:** I would implement a meaningful core mission in my own game to keep players engaged and have a goal, most likely without a time limit.

## 3. Exploration and Discovery
Giving players the ability to explore the world around them supports their curiosity and creates a more immersive experience. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a great example of this.
**Pros:** Creates a real-world experience and makes the players' adventure unique to them through limitless discovery. 
**Cons:** Can create confusion and distract players from completing the main quest, or generally lose focus on their mission. Not enough of a reward system can also demotivate players. 
**Usage:** As much as I would love to implement this game design principle in my own, it would take a lot more time, effort, and years of experience before building an immersive open-world experience. I may opt to design a simple open-world as my focus mechanic so it’s not as overwhelming.

##  Summary of Usage
I would use enough balanced choices to give players options to choose from, and can assist them in-game, but not too many to overwhelm them. Providing a meaningful core mission without time constraints, but keeping players motivated to finish the game. Lastly, I wish to implement an exploration mechanic as I create more games in the future, but as of now, given the complexity of a truly open-world game, I would try my best to limit other factors while making it as immersive as possible if I decide to implement an exploration principle.
